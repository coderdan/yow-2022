# Attack Demos from Yow! Lambda Jam 2022

This repo contains two demos of breaking encryption as shown in my talk at Lambda Jam.

## Yow

This demo contains an example of how to break AES-GCM if messages were not encrypted with unique IVs.

## Cloak Demo

This is a demo of using Cloak in Ecto but with a fatal flaw which I exploit.
